# EF-Core-N-Layer-Template-with-Generic-Repository-Pattern

This GitHub repository contains a template for building a .NET application using an N-Layer architecture with Entity Framework (EF) Core configuration and a generic repository pattern. This setup is designed to provide a robust and maintainable foundation for your application, allowing you to easily extend and scale your project.

<h3>Introduction</h3>
Modern software applications often require a well-structured architecture to manage complexity, facilitate maintainability, and promote scalability. This template provides a starting point for building .NET applications with a well-organized N-Layer architecture:

Presentation Layer: This layer is responsible for the user interface and interaction with the end-users. It typically includes web controllers, views, and APIs.

Business Logic Layer: Here, you encapsulate the application's core business rules and workflows. It's the heart of your application and should remain independent of the data access layer.

Data Access Layer: This layer handles data access, often using EF Core to interact with a database. It includes repositories that abstract the data storage, ensuring a clean separation between the business logic and data access.

<h3>Features</h3>
N-Layer architecture with clear separation of concerns.
Entity Framework Core configuration for data access.
Generic repository template to simplify data operations.
Dependency Injection for services.
Pre-configured application settings.
Basic error handling and logging setup.
Sample models and database context.
Unit tests for repositories and services.

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
To get started with this template, follow these steps:

Clone or download this repository to your local development environment.
Ensure you have .NET Core installed.Configure your database connection string in appsettings.json and the Startup.cs file.Run the following commands to apply EF Core migrations and create the database:

bash
Copy code
update database 
Start building your application by adding models, services, and controllers within the respective layers. Customize the template according to your application's specific requirements.

<h3>Architecture Overview</h3>
This template follows a strict N-Layer architecture, promoting the separation of concerns. The key components are as follows: Presentation Layer: In the Controllers folder, you'll find the API controllers for handling HTTP requests.Business Logic Layer: The Services folder contains services that encapsulate the application's business logic. Add your custom business logic here.Data Access Layer: The Data folder includes the Entity Framework Core database context, models, and generic repositories for data operations.

Infrastructure: The Utils folder contains utility classes and settings.

<h3>Usage</h3>
To use the generic repository, follow these steps:

Create your model class, such as MyEntity, within the Models folder. Create a repository interface, e.g., IMyEntityRepository, and extend the IRepository<MyEntity> interface. Place it in the Repositories folder.
Implement the repository interface in a concrete class, e.g., MyEntityRepository. Add custom methods for specific data operations if needed.
Inject the repository into your services and utilize it to perform data operations.

csharp
Copy code
`public class MyService
{
    private readonly IMyEntityRepository _repository;

    public MyService(IMyEntityRepository repository)
    {
        _repository = repository;
    }

    // Implement your business logic using the repository.
}`

<h3>Customization</h3>
You can customize this template to meet your application's specific needs. Consider the following:

Add your custom models, services, and controllers within their respective layers. Extend the database context and models for your specific data requirements. Modify the repository pattern or data access methods as needed. Enhance error handling and logging to fit your application's requirements.
